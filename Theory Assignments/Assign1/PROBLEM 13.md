Start

Input two jugs size, M and N (M should be > N)

Find out GCD of M and N

The amount of water that's a multiple of GCD can be measured

If the required amount of water can't be expressed as a multiple of the GCD of M and N, then don't measure water

Fill either jug completely

Pour water from one jug to another until one jug is full or the other is empty

Empty any jug completely

Repeat from step 6 until you get the desired amount
